# My Coding Playground üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub repo!
This is where I push my LeetCode solutions and some of my casual code experiments.

It‚Äôs a mix of problem-solving practice, small projects, and random snippets I build while learning and exploring.

# About üìù

LeetCode Solutions ‚Üí Written mainly in C++, sometimes in Python for variety.

Casual Code ‚Üí Anything from tiny projects, algorithm tests, to fun experiments.

Purpose ‚Üí Improve problem-solving skills, learn by building, and track my coding journey.

### Progress

- Solved 300+ LeetCode problems so far

- Continuously pushing more solutions as I learn

- Exploring concepts like OOP, data structures, and algorithms

- Tech Stack

Languages: C++, Python, Dart (Flutter), Assembly (x86)

Tools: Git, VS Code, LeetCode Playground, DOSBox (for Assembly)

### Goals

Solve 500+ LeetCode problems this year

Build mini-projects alongside problem-solving

Document learning journey through this repo
